# RpiVirtualWxStation

There are many variants of virtual weather stations on the web and github. However, many gather information directly from some type of display device through the attached USB.  My device doesn't have a USB.  So I created this configuration to gather my weather.  

Hardware:
Acurite 5n1 (not the pro) 433 mhz
Raspberry Pi 2
SDL-SDR DV2000
